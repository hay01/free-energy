The goal is to place a sharp limit on the energy that might be extracted with waves from the birth alpha particle distribution in an infinite, homogeneous plasma. A resolution would hold particular significance for the channeling of alpha particle energy in fusion devices as well as laser-plasma interactions. In Hamiltonian systems, the 'restacking' algorithm for the redistribution of particle density in phase space provides a bound consistent with Liouville's theorem.

However, in dissipative systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium, the phase space evolution is more complicated and the bound is unknown. In the ubiquitous quasilinear regime of wave-particle interaction, waves effectively diffuse particles throughout the phase space. We bound the extractable energy in an N-level system under the action of general diffusive processes that equalize two levels' populations. The space of states accessible with similar level-mixing operations has been considered in many other contexts, ranging from economic inequality to chemical reaction kinetics.
